# Ensuring Package Reliability: Testing and Performance Validation

Semiconductor Packaging Course Module 4

Lesson 1
Testing at different stages

The first place where we see or do testing is either at the foundry or the OSAT at the die level. This test is called the wafer probe test. We also have big machines which test the package along with the SLTs which test different systems at the OSAT.
